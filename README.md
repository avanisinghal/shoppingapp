A basic shopping website.
One of the basic projects I have worked on in the last two years is a simple shopping website prototype. In this project, my role was as a front-end developer responsible for creating the user interface and implementing basic functionality. 
My main responsibilities in the project included:  
Designing the layout and structure of the website using HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and responsive design. 
Implementing interactive elements and animations using JavaScript to enhance user experience. 
Creating product listings with images, descriptions, and prices to simulate a real shopping experience. 
Implementing a basic search functionality to allow users to search for products based on keywords. 
Developing a simple shopping cart feature to enable users to add products and proceed to checkout. 
Integrating dummy data to populate the website with sample products and information. 
Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness to make the website accessible on different devices. 
Throughout the project, I focused on creating a user-friendly interface with basic shopping functionalities to showcase the concept of an online shopping website. I also conducted testing to ensure the website's functionality and responsiveness.
